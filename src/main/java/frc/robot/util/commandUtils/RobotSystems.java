/** 
 * <h1>RobotSystems<h1>
 * <h2>A singleton class for controlling access to our subsystems</h2>
 * <h3>Why:</h3>
 * <p>This is useful because it simplifies access control for the subsystems (Makes it easier to access all of them at once) and forces standardization of how they are called</p>
 * <p>It also fixes the problem with the 2024 robot where CommandFactory methods would rapidly balloon in size because they passed in many subsystem arguments</p>
 * <i>I think the main advantage of this is the standardization of subsystem referencing</i>
 * <h3>USAGE:</h3>
 * <p>To use it, call setSubsystems(...) once in robotContainer after subsystems have been initialized</p>
 * <p>Then, in your CommandFactory, call getInstance() and store the result</p>
 * <p>Use the stored instance to access your subsystems</p>
